This Honeywell air purifier has a very simple user experience. It has one function to spread purified air and 2 buttons and a knob. The clear labeling and distinct characteristics make operating this device very **LEARNABLE**. UX learnability is the ability for a user to accomplish a task for the first time.I have used this air purifier for a year and have never had any operational hiccups. There are two things about it that are a bit odd one, that the air comes out the front grates at about a 45-degree angle and two, the check filter buttons. Each interactable portion of the device is labeled and the buttons are coated in a silver paint making the operation very **LEARNABLE**.

The major dial on top is the key interaction point, its surrounded in white on black bolded text that make it clear what setting you are on. The black arrow on top of the dial affirms your selection of the given cleaning mode and the sound and led under glow tell you its on. Since the modes are from least to greateset it makes choosing a mode **LEARNABLE** since the modes are labled and the sound of fan increases per dial angle. There’s 4 modes, OFF, GERM, GENERAL CLEAN, and ALLERGEN. This is one other point of confusion, judging by the sound of the fan each selection pushes more air volume then the pervious. The word choice I think is **INEFFECTIVE** as “germ” doesn’t mean anything to me and does “general clean” clean germs too? Does “general clean” not clean pollen? I would think it does since there is no change to the filters. The only change is to the sound of the fan spinning faster. The other two buttons are great, once again they are the only other silver items on the black top with bolded black labeling on them and a hole for an led. One states, “Check Filter” and the other “Check Pre-Filter” clicking the buttons gives a nice solid click but no change to the LED hole. I understand what the buttons are supposed to do I just don’t think they do anything. 

Interaction with the air purifier usually follows the same thought process. I dont think about how much air I want to clean or if the air in my room needs to be purified. My thought process is to turn the dial all the way to right until it stops and enjoy fast moving air. In this use case it functions more like a fan, but if a user wants to clean the air in a room I would imagine it going some thing like this. First is to decided how deep of clean the user wants based on the four given modes. Then the user turns the dial to that mode and waits. Since there is no timer its very difficult to judge how much of the room is cleaned. 

Having the interactable portions on top is in my opinion good **MAPPING** since a user can find the top without any lights on making operation easy. Ive never every struggled with operation of this device and only have a one new question, what exactly does the check filter buttons do? Surely the operation manual can answer this but who reads those?
