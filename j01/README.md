This Honeywell air purifier has a very simple user experience. It has one function to spread purified air and 2 buttons and a knob. The clear labeling and distinct characteristics make operating this device very **LEARNABLE**. I have used this air purifier for a year and have never had any operations hiccups. There’s two things about it that’s a bit odd that the air comes out the front grates at 45-degree angle and two check filter buttons. Each interactable portion of the device is labeled and the buttons are coated in a silver paint making the operation very **INTUATIVE**.

The major dial on top is the key interaction point, its surrounded in white on black bolded text that make it clear what setting you are on. The black arrow on top of the dial affirms your selection of the given cleaning mode and the sound and led under glow tell you its on. since the modes are from least to greateset it makes choosing a mode **MEMORABLE**. There’s 4 modes, OFF, GERM, GENERAL CLEAN, and ALLERGEN. This is one other point of confusion, judging by the sound of the fan each selection pushes more air volume then the pervious. The word choice I think is **INEFFECTIVE** as “germ” doesn’t mean anything to me and does “general clean” clean germs too? Does “general clean” not clean pollen? I would think it does since there is no change to the filters. The only change is to the sound of the fan spinning faster. The other two buttons are great, once again they are the only other silver items on the black top with bolded black labeling on them and a hole for an led. One states, “Check Filter” and the other “Check Pre-Filter” clicking the buttons gives a nice solid click but no change to the LED hole. I understand what the buttons are supposed to do I just don’t think they do anything. 

Having the interactable portions on top is in my opinion good **MAPPING** since a user can find the top without any lights on making operation easy. Ive never every struggled with operation of this device and only have a one new question, what exactly does the check filter buttons do? Surely the operation manual can answer this but who reads those?
